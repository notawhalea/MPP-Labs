This is my solutions of five labs.

**FIRST LAB**:heart_eyes:

[Link on technical task](https://bsuir.ishimko.me/mpp-dotnet/1-tracer)

Here im implement a method execution time meter using the StackTrace system class.

The total execution time of the analyzed methods in one thread should also be calculated. To do this, it is enough to calculate the sum of the times of the "root" methods called from the thread.
The trace results of nested methods should be presented in the appropriate place in the results tree.
For time measurements, you should use the Stopwatch class.

The measurement result must be presented in three formats: JSON, XML and YAML. When implementing plugins, you should use ready-made libraries for working with these formats.

I just relax and gained experience here.
